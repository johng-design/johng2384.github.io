      <p>As the world watches the skies for the next privatized space flight, we can expect naturally to see a sharp decline in the health of our oceans as most scientists are starting to report back. The utterly horrifying size of the volcanoes along the pacific rim has been a movie in the making for as long as humans have been on the earth. What is being reported as a thing of potential global diseaster, scientists and world leaders have begun to mark their calendars as we can only expect to see a greater degree of damage done by larger underwater volcanoes. A silent animal, the sheer size of them and the amount of impact they have on their surroundings is quite interestingly the most prolific way to study where the earth got its origins and the amount of catastrophic events that are solely dependent on the shifting of plates. We know that the planet has evolved exponentially as have its inhabitants, however regardless of current thoughts and modern advancement in technology we still are no closer to understanding the way we could step in front of a problem of that calber.</p>
      <p>The most recent report back from the latest studies show that as shifting of the plates occurs, once silent or dormant volcanoes are gaining life and breathing fire into the skies and under the ocean. Watching local wildilife, we often see the greatest loss in masses of fish during the predetermined days leading up to an explosion. Once thought of as merely a scare tactic to force local inhabitants off of precious home land, now we see the evacuation of islands around the world and know that the only force of human nature that can control this type of activity, is simply to acept the loss as our ability to gain control is chaotically slipping away. We hope to see others getting in touch with their water sources and maintaining an appreciation for the world that surrounds them, as time only tells what happens at this point. </p>
